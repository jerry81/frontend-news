- numerical order
- alphabetical order 

Selection sort

overview: find minimum, swap with first item, repeat on remaining items

pseudo code 

for each item 
  first item is min 
  for remaining items 
    find min item less than first item in remaining items 
  swap min item less than first item with first item (could swap with itself
  )  

complexity n^2

Counting sort

overview - get range of numbers first, build counting map/array, iterate this map/array and build the sorted array

pseudo code

(get range)
for each item
  search for min and max 
(build lookup array)
for each item in range(min, max)
  lookup[item] = []
for each index
  lookup[A[index]] += index 
for each arr in lookup 
  add arr to sorted

complexity n + k

Merge sort 

overview - merge each item in array into larger sorted chunks, then merge the sorted chunks into larger chunks until done 

pseudocode
given A 
for chunks of 2 [a,b] until last item 
if b < a swap a, b
for those chunks of 2 A=[a,b] B=[c,d]
while True 
  if (!A.length && !B.length)  
    add sorted to pool 
  if (A.length)
    sorted.push(...A)
  else if (B.length)
    sorted.push(...B)
  else if (A[0] < B[0]) sorted.push[A.shift()] else sorted.push(B.shift())

complexity n log n 

python [].sort() is n log n
